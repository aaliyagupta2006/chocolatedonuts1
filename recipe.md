Melt the chocolate and butter together in a saucepan over a medium heat.
Stir in the cocoa powder, sugar, and vanilla extract.
Take off the heat and whisk in the eggs one at a time.
Tear off a piece of greaseproof paper and scrunch into a small ball.
Pre-heat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Place the the paper balls in the centre of each hole in a muffin tin. Pour the chocolate doughnut mixture in the muffin tin holes, circling around the paper balls and being careful not to cover them.
Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes.
Carefully take the doughnuts out of the muffin tin. Take out the paper balls with your fingers. You should have a circle-shaped hole in each doughnut.
Dip in some melted chocolate, followed by some sprinkles.
AND EAT!!!!
