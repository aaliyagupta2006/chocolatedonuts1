MY FAVOURITE DESSERT ARE DONUTS! They are Covered in a thick chocolate glaze, these are perfect for any chocoholic who wants a chocolate version of this classic treat.
I love the fun shape of donuts and the colorful sprinkles or creamy glaze that covers the top. These chocolate glazed donuts are baked instead of fried, giving them a moist, cake-like texture and are a healthier alternative to a classic fried donut.
It's not just about that chocolate glaze or pink frosting with sprinkles, even the bread is very tasty and soft!
